# ğŸŒ» hi i am derp :3 ğŸŒ»

### ğŸŒ» welcome to my git garden
ğŸŒ» i do stuff here in my free time.

ğŸŒ» planning to become a game dev in the future :questionmark:

ğŸŒ» a programmer in general

ğŸŒ» :3

ğŸŒ» Fun fact: one thing on my github is that i usually misspell every time i commit. and like, couldn't edit it regardless but whats important to me is the idea and the gist of the commits/contributions. They're special on most moments and the satisfaction of getting what it supposed to program to is so worth it spite the time spent on coding. :3
